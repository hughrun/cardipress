This is a Wordpress theme for the new newCardigan website.

It is fairly vanilla, with some customised functions on the homepage to pull in specific categories. It uses CSS `grid`, with some fallbacks for IE.

# Contributor Guide
If you notice any bugs that can be cleaned up, by all means send a pull request. I'm not actively seeking contributors, however: this repo is really just to show my work ;-)
